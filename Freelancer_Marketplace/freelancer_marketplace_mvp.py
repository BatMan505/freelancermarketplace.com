I can update your `Businees Ideals` ZIP to include the new features:

- Create and edit profile (bio, skills, experience, portfolio)
- Add and manage services with prices and delivery times
- Receive ratings and reviews on services
- Chat with clients

The updated ZIP will contain both backend and frontend code with all APIs and React components for these features. It will be ready to download and run locally.
